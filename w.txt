‘The Tale of Melon City’ runs like folk tale. The city is called Melon
      City because its ruler is a melon. There is a curious tale around it. Once
      a fair and gentle king ruled over a state. He got an arch built across the
      thoroughfare. As he passed under the low arch it struck his head and he
      lost his crown. He thought it a disgrace and ordered the chief of builders
      to be hanged. The chief lay the blame on the workmen. The workmen were
      surprised. They said that the bricks were made of wrong size. So the
      masons were thought guilty. The masons shifted the blame on the architect.
      The architect put the blame at the king’s door as he had amended his
      original plan. The king sought a wise man’s counsel. He held the arch
      guilty and ordered it to be hanged. A councillor objected to it as it had
      touched the king’s head. The people became restless. They wanted to see
      someone hanging. Only the king’s head could fit. the noose. So he was
      hanged. It was now announced that the next man who passed the City Gate
      would choose the king. An idiot came. He suggested ‘A melon’. So melon was
      crowned the king. He was taken to the throne. He was called melon king.
